      <h3>Why White Center?</h3>
      <p>
        White center is an extremely unique community of approximately 32,000 people located now
        throughout three jurisdictions: unincorporated King Country, City of Burien and the City of
        Seattle. White Center has the distinct characteristics of an historic streetcar-era suburb,
        and has retained most of the original buildings constructed during 1912 and 1933 (King County
        did a Historic Survey of downtown Whit Center and is recommending that the CDA designate forty-seven
        buildings as local historic landmarks). At the same time, due to a substantial amount of inexpensive,
        small commercial spaces and the affordability of nearby housing, White Center has become a welcoming
        gateway for immigrants and refugees who arrived, settled, raised families, established businesses
        and grew social, cultural, and religious institutions.

        <h4>What is Family Development?</h4>
        <p> We support White Center children and adults in knowledge-building, access to services, and leadership opportunities that will assist them in achieving their goals.  We connect families to schools, community resources, opportunities, and each other.  Our activities are offered in multiple languages including English, Vietnamese, Somali, and Spanish.</p>

        <h4> Awet Ghebreyohanne's Story</h4>
        <p>"It snowed really hard the first day I was in the U.S., said Awet Ghebretohannes. In Eritrea, it would snow lightly, but here it was too much so I was stuck inside my house for the first three weeks! All I wanted to do was get out and explore."
        <br>
      </br>
        Since that blizzard in 2008, Awet Ghebreyohanne haas done lots exploring. After moving his family to White Center (he and his wife have two young children), he volunteered at the Greenbridge YCA as a computer instructor and did interpreting for Neighborhood House. However, he found his calling after he completed weatherization training through a project called Got Green, which educates the community about livable wagejobs and energy conservation. It is sponsered by the White Center Community Development Assocaition. "Got Green is led by youthliving in disadvantaged communities of color," says Awet. "They are looking for a chance at a better life...that's why I got involved."
       <br>
      </br>
        Awet was then hired by us as a Resident Fellow (similar to paid internship), to continue his work with Got Green, with the goal of gaining leadership skills and work experience in environmental justice. To that end, he graduated last spring as a "Carbon Coach" to train otheres how to lessen their carbon footprint. He also wants to start a Green Concil in White Center.
        <br>
      </br>
      "I've learned that the people I have been working with in White Center are highly devoted to what they do," says Awet. "People in White Center represent the world, and the residents trust and respect each other."

          <h3>Community Building</h3>
          <h3>White Center Spring Clean Story</h3>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="pillar--block">
        <h4>What is Community Building?</h4>
        <p>The White Center Community Development Association has held seven Spring Clean Events as of May 2010, an event that brings together volunteer youth and elders, business owners and residents, retirees and stundets to work, clean and improve the community's physical environment.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="pillar--block">
        <h4>White Center Spring Cleaning Story</h4>
        <p>"Whiter Center is people-powered. Events like Spring Clean showcase our collective action for positive neighborhood revitalization that truly defines our diverse neighborhood revitalization that truly defines our diverse community,"said Aileen Balahadia, Executive Director of the White Center Community Development Assocaition. The White Center CDA is a catalyst for healty community and new prosperity in Whiter Center - so it's a better place to visit, shop, and live. Asked why she participates in the Spring Clean event, Whiter Center resident Keysha Bryant said: "You must be the change you wishto see in your community, to help build and keep it a clean safe place for children and everyone who lives here."</p>
        <br>
      </br>
      <p>In 2010, over 350 volunteers turned out for the Spring Clean event. We painted one block-long mural previously plagued with graffiti, cleaned and painted art on 21 trash cans for the business district, removed invasive plant species at six parks, and hauled away two tons of garbage. Volunteers covered 70 neighborhood blocks, picking up litter and completing 20 beautification projects developed by local residents and groups.</p>

          <h3>Wan Ngo's Story</h3>

      <div class="pillar--block">
        <h4>What is Neighborhood Revitalization?</h4>
        <p>We seek to attract investment itno neighborhood, support entrepreneurship and small business development, improve community health and safety, and increase affordable housing options using a community-based economic development approach.</p>

        <h4>Wan Ngo's Story</h4>
        <p>Dental Technician, Wan Ngo, has lived and worked in many places-from Connecticut to California-since he moved to the United States from Vietnam, but he likes White Center. When
          asked his reasons for locating 1st Impressions Dental and Denture here, he said, "Multiculture, that's one of them. It's a small town, but you have lots of help. A good place to grow business, easy to operate, easy to get permit. A friendly toen. I walk here at nights, no problem,"</p>
          <br>
        </br>
        <p>
        In late October, Wan and his wife plan to open a frozen yogurt shop next door to the dental office. "We have the permit and everything. We're ready to build a plae for people to sit down. Sit down and talk about their business. This is a place where people can have a little meeting. They can sit down and chat."</p>
        <br>
      </br>
      <p>
      Wan wants to advertise Whiter Center so people won't just think it's a place somewhere around Burien. "We need to broadcast ourselves-2 miles, 5 miles, 10 miles, 20 miles. We want to build our name here." </p>
